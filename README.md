This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript error: passing an array to a function expecting a string.  The `greeter` function expects a string, but an array is passed, leading to a runtime error (or a type error if stricter type checking is enabled). The solution shows how to correctly handle this scenario, either by modifying the function to accept arrays or by changing how the array is used.
